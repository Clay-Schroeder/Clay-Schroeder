    <p align="CENTER">Crystallography: Miller Indices</p>
    <p><b>Miller Indices</b> are a symbolic vector representation for
      the orientation of an atomic plane in a crystal lattice and are
      defined as the reciprocals of the fractional intercepts which the
      plane makes with the crystallographic axes.</p>
    <p>The method by which indices are determined is best shown by
      example. Recall, that there are three axes in crystallographic
      systems (*except sometimes in the hexagonal system adopts a
      convention where there are four axes). Miller indices are
      represented by a set of 3 integer numbers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Example of the (111) plane:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="111.jpeg"><img style="width:
          257px; height: 353px;" src="111.jpeg" naturalsizeflag="0"
          align="BOTTOM" hspace="5" vspace="4"> </a></p>
    <p>If you want to describe the orientation of a crystal face or a
      plane of atoms within a crystal lattice, then there are series of
      steps that will lead you to its notation using Miller indices.</p>
    <p>1. The first thing that must be acertained are the fractional
      intercepts that the plane/face makes with the crystallographic
      axes. In other words, how far along the unit cell lengths does the
      plane intersect the axis. In the<a href="111.jpeg"> figure above</a>,
      the plane intercepts each axis at exact one unit length.</p>
    <p>2. Step two involves taking the reciprocal of the fractional
      intercept of each unit length for each axis. In the <a
        href="111.jpeg">figure above</a>, the values are all 1/1.</p>
    <p>3. Finally the fractions are cleared (<i>i.e.,</i> make 1 as the
      common denominator).</p>
    <p>4. These integer numbers are then parenthetically enclosed and
      designate that specific crystallographic plane within the lattice.
      Since the unit cell repeats in space, the notation actually
      represents a family of planes, all with the same orientation. In
      the <a href="111.jpeg">figure above</a>, the Miller indice for
      the plane is (111)</p>
    <p></p>
    <hr align="LEFT">Why go through all of these operations?
    <p></p>
    <p>Example of the (101) plane:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="111.jpeg"><img style="width:
          267px; height: 361px;" src="101.jpeg" naturalsizeflag="0"
          align="BOTTOM" hspace="5" vspace="4"> </a></p>
    <p>This becomes immediately apparent when we consider the <a
        href="101.jpeg">case of the (101)</a>. In this case the plane
      intercepts the <i>a</i> axis at one unit length and also the <i>c</i>
      axis at one unit length. The plane however, never intersects the <i>b
      </i>axis. In other words, it can be said that the intercept to the
      <i>b </i>axis is infinity. The intercepts are then designated as
      1,infinity,1. The reciprocals are then 1/1, 1/infinity, 1/1.
      Knowing 1/infinity = 0 then the indices become (101).</p>

    <h3>Closures for crystallographics indices</h3>
    <p>(<i>hkl</i>) = parenthesis designate a <b>crystal face</b> or a
      <b>family of planes</b> throughout a crystal lattice.</p>
    <p>Directions are presented by the three integers <i>uvw</i>.&nbsp;
      [<i>uvw</i>] = square brackets designate a direction in the
      lattice from the origin to a point. Used to collectively,
      they&nbsp; include all the faces of a crystals whose intersects
      (i.e., edges) parallel each other. These are referred to as
      crystallographic <b>zones</b> and they represent a direction in
      the crystal lattice.</p>

    <p>{<i>hkl</i>} = "squiggly" brackets designate a set of face planes
      that are equivalent by the symmetry of the crystal. The set of
      face planes results in the <b>crystal form</b>. {100} in the
      isometric class includes (100), (010), (001), (-100), (0-10) and
      (00-1), while for the triclinic {100} only the (100) is included.</p>
    <p><b>d-spacing</b> is defined as the distance between adjacent
