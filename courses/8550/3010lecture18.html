</B></P>

<P><B>The understanding two component systems requires holding one degree
of freedom (variable) constant. <BR>
</B></P>

<P>When pressure is held constant (known as <I>isobaric</I> conditions),
then T and X are varied.<BR>
</P>

<P>Recall that when two components can mix on an atomic scale then they
are considered <B>miscible phases</B> and a solution results<B>.<BR>

<P>Points to make:<BR>
</P>

<P>1. <B>Liquidus Diagram</B></P>

<P>2. <B>liquidus</B> - upper portion where melt is in equilibrium with
crystalline phase.</P>

<P>3<B>. solidus</B> - lower portion where crystalline phase is in equilibrium
with melt.</P>

<P>4. Path depicts the evolution of melt and crystalline phase composition.</P>

<P>5. Note: that this is scenario operates assuming constant re-equilibration
and a closed system.</P>

<P>6. <B>subsolidus - </B>region below solidus where all solid-state transformations
may take place.<BR>
</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Olivine Series</B> is an example of solid-solution
series that is maintained over regardless of temperature (also includes
high temperature portion of the plagioclase series).<BR>

<P>Example from an actual olivine grain:</P>

<P>Core: Mg<SUB>1.63</SUB> Fe<SUB>0.36</SUB></P>

<P>Rim: Mg<SUB>1.01</SUB> Fe<SUB>0.78 </SUB></P>

<P>Zonation in the olivine crystal shows us that equilibrium conditions
did not exist. This potentially tells us information about cooling rate.<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>Coexistance without mixing is known as <B>immisciblity</B>. <BR>

<P>At high temperature - 1. structure expands, 2. Vibration of atoms larger,
3. distinct structural sites become similar. <BR>
</P>

<P>Consequence is that cation of different size can occupy the same site.
<BR>
</P>

<P>e.g., Na<SUP>+</SUP> (1.18&Aring;) and K<SUP>+</SUP> (1.33&Aring;) in
feldspars<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Exsolution</B> - As tempertures decrease, diffusion of atoms within
crystal occurs. Inital solid-solutions undergo &quot;unmixing&quot; into
two separate, distinct crystalline phases.<BR>
</P>

<P><B>Analogy</B>: Vigourously shaken oil and water mixture will mix for
a short time. With time they will &quot;unmix&quot;<BR>
</P>

<P>See figure 5.21 (page 238). Subsolidus - phase diagram. <BR>
</P>

<P>Define:<BR>
</P>

<P>1. Miscibility gap - region in T-X space where solid-solution compositions
are not formed due to exsolution.</P>

<P>2. Phase changes take place in the <B>subsolidus <BR>
</B></P>

<P>Examples: hornblende - grunerite, Labradorite An<SUB>47</SUB>-An<SUB>58</SUB>
<BR>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>No solid-solution <BR>

<P><B>Silica* - albite system<BR>
</B></P>

<P><B>*</B> Silica as quartz never crystallizes from solution in water free
systems (crystobilite and tridymite). But, for the purpose of our discussion
(<I>i.e.</I>, a binary system) we will ignore the third component water.<BR>

<OL>
  <LI>Imagine a melt containing the ions Na<SUP>+</SUP> , Al<SUP>3+</SUP>
  , Si<SUP>4+</SUP> , O<SUP>2-</SUP> with equal amounts of Na and Al and
  excess Si and enough O to keep things electrically neutral.
  <LI>Above the melting temperature vigorous particle motion keeps forming
  and breaking of the Si-O bonds and Al and Na prevent the Si-O bonds from
  firmly locking into bonds.
  <LI>As the temperature cools Si-O bonds lock and SiO<SUB>2</SUB> crystals
  start forming.
  <LI>The growth of SiO<SUB>2</SUB> crystals change the composition of the
  remaining liquid. (<I>i.e</I>., the liquid is impoverished in Si and enriched
  in Al and Na).
  <LI>If the temperature does not drop any more, then no additional SiO<SUB>2</SUB>
  crystals will form.
  <LI>The process does not occur in steps, but is continuous. Therefore,
  in the first figure below there is a line from X<SUB>1</SUB> to X<SUB>2</SUB>
  .
  <LI>The line becomes steeper as crystallization proceeds.
  <LI>A similar crystallization process occurs for albite in melts that are
  enriched in Al and Na.
  <LI>The completed pathway is shown on the second diagram below.
  <LI>The location marked Z is a point in T-X space where both crystals will
  grow. This point is known as the <B>eutectic point.</B>
  <LI>The curve that represents the loci of points between melt and solid
  regions (<I>i.e</I>., phase fields) is termed the <B>liquidus.</B>
  <LI>The arrows on the boundaries of the phase fields represent the crystallization
  paths with decreasing temperature.
  <LI>Note that this diagram represent <B>isobaric</B> conditions. The phase
  relations will change with changing pressure. In the final diagram, lets
  consider a system in the state at point D in the diagram below.
  <LI>At a low pressure the system will exist as a single phase (liquid)
  state.
  <LI>If the pressure is raised, then two phases can coexist (liquid and
  silica) and crystallization will occur.<BR>

<H4>Caveats - <BR>
</H4>

<P>16. The effect of changing pressure (increased or decreased) can cause
melting or crystallization. The effect is dependent upon all components
in the system.</P>

<P><BR>
17. In an ideal binary system, usually the effect of increased pressure
will cause crystallization (at the same temperature).</P>

<P><BR>
18. The presence of water (a third component) is likely to significantly
alter the behavior of a system.
