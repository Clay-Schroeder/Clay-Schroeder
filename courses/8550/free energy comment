Congratulations for your web pages concerning clay chemistry. Great !I have a problem concerning a small part : A new parameter may be defined which is the specific interfacial free energy between crystal and solution (s).Where, s = dG interf / dA (3)and A = surface area of the crystal.Estimated values for interfacial free energy of solids in water (from table 5-1 Berner 1980)  Substance               s (erg/cm2) Calcite                    80 Gypsum                    76 Silica glass                    46 Sylvite                    30 Hematite                   1200 Goethite                   1600Note: Low values for salts of carbonate and sulfate.High value for oxides and hydroxides.Clay values???It is now to estimate the surface tension of pure solids and (after) the surface tensions of solid-lquid interfaces starting from clorimetry or adsorption measurements.The method is semi-empirical (the thermodynamics is correct, some parameters are empiric) but the results are in agreement with available data.List of publication : "Surface Gibbs free energy of minerals: some values" J.M.
