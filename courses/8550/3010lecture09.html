The electrons are then accelerated into a metal target (typicallya copper anode). The energy released results in two types of X-radiation.</p>  <p>The first type is known as <b>white radiation</b> and consists of a broad,continuous spectrum containing many wavelengths of radiation. It is a resultof the very rapid deceleration of electrons as they encounter the strongelectric fields of target metal. As the electrons collide they lose energy(often designated <font face="Symbol">D</font>E) and that energy goes intomaking X-ray photons. That energy, <font face="Symbol">D</font>E is related to the frequency of the X-ray radiation by Planck's Constant,</p>  <p></p><center><font face="Symbol">D</font>E = h <font face="Symbol">n</font></center><p></p>  <ul>   <li>h = planck's constant (h = 6.6 x10<sup>-34</sup> kg&middot;m<sup>2</sup>&middot;s<sup>-1</sup>,)   </li>  <li><font face="Symbol">n </font>= frequency of the X-ray radiation </li></ul>  <p>Also recall that,</p>  <p></p><center><font face="Symbol">n </font>= c / <font face="Symbol">l</font></center><p></p>  <ul>   <li><font face="Times">c = speed of light</font>   </li>  <li> <font face="Symbol">l = </font><font face="Times"> wavelength</font>   </li></ul>  <p>Therefore,</p>  <p></p><center><font face="Symbol">D</font>E = h c / <font face="Symbol">l</font></center><p></p>  <p>The inverse relationship between energy and wavelength indicates thatthe wavelength of radiation becomes smaller with larger energy transitions.</p>  <p><b>White radiation intensity as a function of energy potential (voltage)</b></p>  <p><a href="whiterad.gif"><img src="whiterad.gif" height="248" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="bottom" width="393" naturalsizeflag="0"></a></p>  <p>The other type of X-radiation is termed <b>characteristic radiation</b> which is characteristic of the metal target.</p>  <p>Recall electrons orbiting close to the nucleus are tightly bound. Whensource electrons strike these core shell/orbital electrons, the electronsget bounced out of position (in other words the electrons undergo an energytransition). This event is immediately followed by another electron droppingback toward the nucleus. Much like dropping a book on the desk, the releasein energy appears as an emitted photon with a distinct or characteristicfrequency.</p>  <p><a href="kalpha.jpeg"><img src="kalpha.jpeg" height="363" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="bottom" width="465" naturalsizeflag="0"></a></p>  <p>The energy difference between electron levels are quantum amounts andthe amount released will depend upon the number of protons and neutrons inthe nucleus and the shell from which the electron was displaced.</p>  <p>In geology labs, the most common targets used are copper and cobalt.</p>  <p>Since there are only two possible sites in the L shell (quantum number<i>n</i> = <i>2s</i>) of a copper atom, we have two slightly different energytransitions (i.e. L --&gt; K or <i>2s</i> --&gt; <i>1s</i>) : K<font face="Symbol">a</font><sub>1</sub>, from the outer most L shell and K<font face="Symbol">a</font><sub>2</sub>.</p>  <p>The result is the production of very intense monochromatic radiation.This is the radiation that we take advantage of when doing X-ray crystallography.</p>  <p><a href="charrad.gif"><img src="charrad.gif" height="248" hspace="5" vspace="4" align="bottom" width="357" naturalsizeflag="0"></a></p>  <h3><hr align="left">Diffraction Effects</h3>  <p>What are some common examples of diffraction effects?</p>  <p>1. rainbow from the film of oil on water</p>  <p>2. intersection of ripples on a pond.</p>  <p></p><hr align="left"><i>The essential feature for the diffraction phenomenonis that the distances between the scattering points is of the same magnitudeas the wavelength of the waves being scattered.</i><p></p>  <p></p><hr align="left">What is the typical repeat distance for a crystal unit cell?(about 5-10 &Aring;).<p></p>  <p>Wavelength of Cu<font face="Symbol">a</font><sub>1</sub> = 1.54059 &Aring;</p>  <p>When a monochromatic X-ray strikes a crystal, the X-rays are scatteredby the electron clouds of the atoms in the crystal.</p>  <p>There are three ways in which the scattering (<i>i.e.</i>, the re-radiationof electrons) is modified;</p>  <p>1.
