<P><B>Abstract</B></P>

<P>The mineral assemblages in a vertical weathering profile developed over
a meta-gabbro terrain were studied for their stoichiometry and relative
abundances. The site is located in the Piedmont Province in the southeast
portion of the Appalachians orogenic belt in a forested residual landscape
and a temperate climate. The soil is classified as a fine mixed thermic
Ultic Hapludalf and defined by distinct A-, B- and C-horizons with thicknesses
of 17, 62 and ~250 cm, respectively.</P>

<P>The primary mineral assemblage consists of 44% (weight percent) andesine,
40% hornblende, 6% quartz, 4% biotite, 3% ilmenite/titanomagntite/rutile/sphene
grains and 3% epidote. Quantitative XRD, detailed XRD clay mineralogy and
thin-section petrography revealed the incipient breakdown of the primary
minerals to vermiculite (after biotite oxidation), randomly ordered mixed-layer
mica/vermiculite/smectite (as grain coatings), kaolin group minerals (after
mafic silicate dissolution), goethite and hematite. Vermiculite (after biotite),
expandable clay coatings and all the primary minerals (with exception to
quartz) are dissolved away from the A-horizon. Hydroxy-interlayered-vermiculite
and minor amounts of gibbsite occur as tertiary phases in the A-horizon.</P>

<P>Using mineral stoichiometries and average abundances for the parent rock
and C-, B- and A-horizon, estimates of primary mineral mass loss were determined.
The bicarbonate to silica ratio expected from the mineral loss reactions
is 6 times higher than the ratio observed in average groundwaters of the
Georgia Piedmont. This suggests that, although weathering of mafic terrains
is important to the long-term process of transferring CO<SUB>2 </SUB>to
the oceans, the present day contribution of silicate weathering in temperature
climates may be more largely influenced by the weathering of felsic terrain.</P>

<P><B>1. Introduction</B></P>

<P>There is little doubt that silicate weathering of continental crust is
an essential process in stabilizing the long-term global geochemical cycles
of elements such as carbon in the atmosphere (Berner and Berner, 1987).
CO<SUB>2</SUB> is removed from the atmosphere via hydrolysis reactions between
carbonic acid and silicates. The weathering of mafic silicates is particularly
important because the soluble ions of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>, Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> and
HCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> formed during weathering, are ultimately sequestered
and buried in the oceans as carbonate minerals. At the same time, felsic
silicates also undergo weathering and deliver soluble K<SUP>+</SUP>, Na<SUP>+</SUP>
and HCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> to the oceans. The dissolution and precipitation
rates at which the mineral constituents of felsic versus mafic silicate
terrain undergo during weathering are still being established (Velbel et
al., 1996; Velbel, 1992). The extent to which silicate weathering is responsible
for contributing to the consumption of CO<SUB>2</SUB> via weathering has
therefore yet to be firmly established.</P>

<P>In this light, geochemical mass balance studies of mafic and felsic terrains
are an essential starting point for revealing the importance of silicate
weathering. Mass balance approaches must start with an accurate characterization
of the parent, secondary and tertiary mineral assemblages present in the
weathering profile. Most present day mineral assemblages in a weathering
profile represent a dynamic balance between the addition of parent rock
through regional uplift and the removal processes of physical and chemical
mass loss (Pavich, 1989). The types and quantities of minerals however,
can also be considered to represent a snapshot of relict steady-state conditions
that may have formed in response to different regional climatic conditions.
The purpose of this study is to assess the mineral assemblages associated
with a temperate upland weathering profile whose parent rock-type is mafic
in composition. This study is intended to provide a contextual backdrop
for future comparative mass-balance studies to be used to reconcile the
importance of mafic versus felsic weathering to the balance of the carbon
cycle.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><I>1.1 Study site</I></P>

<P>The study site lies within the Woodville Quadrangle, in the Daniel Springs
community, Greene County, Georgia, USA (82&deg; 75&#146; 42&quot; longitude,
33&deg; 39&#146; 00&quot; latitude). The region comprises part of the Paleozoic
Piedmont Province to the southeast of the Appalachians Mountains. The study
site has affinities to the Carolina Slate Belt which contains abundant volcanoclastic
rocks intruded by mafic to felsic dikes that have been subsequently metamorphosed
(Lovingood, 1983; Conway 1986). The specific coring site is located in a
large (15 km<SUP>2</SUP> ) area that has been mapped as the Daniel Springs
meta-gabbro. The site occurs on a local topographic high (elevation 165
m) and aside from potential aeolian inputs, it is assumed to be a wholly
residual weathering profile.</P>

<P>It is likely that the land was once cultivated (50 years ago) for agricultural
use and it is assumed that soils were not tilled beyond 30 cm depth. Present
day vegetation consists of mature mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.
Mean annual rainfall is 125 cm yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and mean annual temperature
is 23&deg; C (Hodler and Schretter, 1986).</P>

<P><B>2. Methods</B></P>

<P>Sampling was performed with both a hand auger and a Gidding&#146;s<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
hydraulic coring device mounted on a truck. The core stem utilized a 5 cm
diameter core tube. The soil profile was described using standard terminology
(Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). Munsell colors and Hurst&#146;s (1977)
color index (H* L/C) were determined on moist samples.</P>

<P>Both whole rock/saprolite/soil material and size-fractionated materials
were examined for mineral content. The clay-size fraction (&lt;2 &micro;m)
was separated using wet sieving and centrifugation techniques (Hathaway,
1956). Major mineral modal analysis and clay mineralogical analysis were
performed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). XRD analyses were conducted
using a Scintag XDS-2000 diffractometer. Experimental parameters were optimized
for quantification (Hurst<I> et al</I>, 1997) and included CuK</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
radiation, 40kV, 35 mA, 1&deg;/2&deg; divergence slits, 0.5&deg;/0.3&deg;
receiving slits and a scan rate of 2&deg; 2</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>Q</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">/min.
Quantitative XRD measurements were made using reference-intensity-ratios
derived from a 20% by weight added </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">-Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>
internal standard (Chung, 1974a; Chung, 1974b). Peaks for the various minerals
were referenced to the internal standard peak (</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">-Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>)
at 43.3&deg; 2</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">Q</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">.</P>

<P>Clay samples were sedimented to infinite thickness on glass petrographic
slides and air-dried (Moore and Reynolds, 1997). The clays were pretreated
with K<SUP>+</SUP> and Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> saturation and then analyzed in the
air-dried, ethylene glycol, 300&deg; C and 550&deg; C treated states for
identification of hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV), gibbsite, kaolinite
and mixed-layer mica/smectite. Kaolinite and halloysite were not discriminated
in the quantitative XRD results therefore, all 7.1 &Aring; phases represented
in the diffractograms are hereafter collectively referred to as kaolin group
minerals.</P>

<P>Mixed-layering XRD patterns were simulated using NEWMOD<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
(Reynolds, 1985). Trioctahedral smectite and trioctahedral mica structures
were used as input for layer types. The upper limit of scattering domain
size (N) was set to 6, so as to approximately reproduce the peak broadening
seen in the observed diffraction patterns.</P>

<P>A petrographic microscope and electron microprobe were employed to examine
detailed grain morphological relationships and for mineral identification.
Thin sections were prepared using standard vacuum epoxy impregnation methods
(Fitzpatrick, 1993). Sections were polished and selected grains were chemically
analyzed using an electron microprobe (JEOL superprobe<SUP>&reg;</SUP>)
operating at 15 kV and 15nA.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>3. Results</B></P>

<P><I>3. 1 Soil description</I></P>

<P>The coring operation retrieved 200 cm of continuous sampling. A schematic
description of the soil/saprolite profile is shown in <A HREF="DS1.gif">figure
1</A>. The soil is classified as a fine, mixed, thermic Ultic Hapludalf
and displays properties similar to the regional Macklenburg and Enon Series
mapped in nearby Oglethorpe County (Frost, 1991). In general terms, the
depth profile of recovered core contains a 0 to 17 cm A-horizon, a 17 to
79 cm B-horizon and a 79 to 200 cm portion of the C-horizon. Coring and
auguring resistance encountered at 200 cm suggests that parent rock occurs
within 300 cm of the surface.</P>

<P><I>3.2 Parent rock mineralogy</I></P>

<P>Quantitative analysis of the underlying Daniel Springs meta-gabbro can
be inferred from petrographic examination of the saprolite (<A HREF="DS2.gif">Figure
2a</A>) in conjunction with previous petrographic studies. Lovingood (1983)
conducted a thorough modal analysis of the Daniel Springs meta-gabbro using
samples from within the mapped area. Modal analysis however, only provides
mineral abundance data on a volume basis. In order to compare the petrographic
observations of Lovingood (1983) to quantitative XRD results of this study
(reported on a weight percent basis), modal abundances were recast using
the average specific gravity for each primary phase present (Deer et al,
1992). Using this approach (less accessory phases), the meta-gabbro has
recalculated mineral abundances of: plagioclase (An<SUB>40</SUB>), 44%,
hornblende 40%, epidote 3%, quartz 6%, biotite 4% and ilmentite/titanomagnetite/titantite/rutile/sphene
3%. The latter Fe- and Ti-bearing phases are most commonly found together,
occurring as exsolved species in single opaque grains (<A HREF="DS2b.gif">Figure
2b</A>). For the purposes of this study, these opaque grains are collectively
referred to as &quot;ilmenite&quot; and represented by the average composition
(FeO)<SUB>0.40 </SUB>(Fe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB> 0.40</SUB> (TiO<SUB>2</SUB>)<SUB>
0.20</SUB>.</P>

<P>Petrographic observation of the saprolite and microprobe analysis of
residual primary plagioclase and amphibole agrees well with the above estimates
(see below and <A HREF="DStable1.html">Table 1</A>). Using the oxide data
in Table 1, the data have been recast into structural formulae for the plagioclase,
epidote and amphibole. Their formulae are Na<SUB>0.58</SUB>Ca<SUB>0.42</SUB>Al<SUB>1.42</SUB>Si<SUB>2.58</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>
(andesine), Ca<SUB>1.96</SUB> Fe<SUP>3+</SUP><SUB>0.77</SUB> Al<SUB>2.23</SUB>Si<SUB>3.00</SUB>O<SUB>12</SUB>
(OH)<SUB> </SUB> and Na<SUB>0.45 </SUB>Ca<SUB>1.90 </SUB>Mg<SUB>2.33</SUB>
Fe<SUP>2+</SUP><SUB>1.98</SUB> Al<SUB>0.80 </SUB>Si<SUB>6.53 </SUB>Al<SUB>1.45
</SUB>Ti<SUB>0.02 </SUB>O<SUB>22</SUB> (OH)<SUB>2 </SUB>(hornblende), respectively.
Unaltered biotite grains were not observed in the thin section. Therefore,
biotite compositions were estimated on basis of microprobe analyses performed
on biotites found in surrounding rocks. Using the published microprobe analysis
of biotite by Schroeder <I>et al</I>, (1997) and several performed as part
of petrology class projects at the University of Georgia, an average composition
of K<SUB>0.86 </SUB>Mg<SUB>1.21</SUB> Ti<SUB>0.09</SUB> Fe<SUP>2+</SUP><SUB>1.25</SUB>
Al<SUB>0.40 </SUB>Si<SUB>3.00 </SUB>Al<SUB>1.00 </SUB>O<SUB>10</SUB> (OH)<SUB>2</SUB>
is assumed.</P>

<P><I>3.3 C-horizon mineralogy</I></P>

<P><A HREF="DS3.gif">Figure 3</A> shows representative clay mineral XRD
patterns from within the profile. The deepest clay mineral assemblage in
the weathering profile contains both kaolin group minerals and expandable
2:1 clays. Results from modeling of mixed-layer XRD patterns using NEWMOD
indicate the presence of both smectitic and vermiculite layer types with
a high-charged heterogeneous layer charge distribution. This is supported
by the comparative response of Ca- and K-saturated samples (figure 3). Ca-saturated
samples display characteristics of a mixed-layer 10&Aring;/17&Aring;, with
90% expandable layers and random ordering (reichweite or R = 0). The same
sample displays 10&Aring;/17&Aring; mixed-layering, with 50% expandable
layers and R = 0 ordering when K-saturated. The difference in expandability
between the Ca- and K-saturated samples indicates that roughly half of the
smectite layer types are high-charged (<I>i.e</I>., &gt; 0.5 interlayer
equivalent per half unit formula).</P>

<P>Based on the X-ray pattern in <A HREF="DS3.gif">figure 3</A>, the expandable
clays, vermiculite and mixed-layer illite/smectite appear to be the dominant
clay present in the C-horizon, however this is not the case. A relative
comparison of the calculated diffraction pattern intensities for the mixed-layer
illite/smectite and kaolinite, indicate that the kaolin group minerals are
quantitatively the dominant clay, even though the (001) kaolin group reflections
appear with lower intensity. Study of Fe-substitution in kaolinites by Schroeder
and Pruett (1996) and Schroeder et al, (1998) have shown that most kaolins
display near ideal stoichiometry relative to other clays. The upper limit
of ferric Fe-substitution for Al in kaolinite is about 1 in 30 (<I>i.e</I>.
Al<SUB>1.93</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.07</SUB>Si<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>(OH)<SUB>4</SUB>).
Considering the contribution of Fe of kaolin minerals is small relative
to other Fe-bearing minerals, their composition is idealized to be Al<SUB>2</SUB>Si<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB>(OH)<SUB>4</SUB>
for the purposes of this study.</P>

<P>Petrographic examination of C-horizon saprolite supports the XRD observations
that clays are both expandable and kaolin group minerals. In thin-section,
kaolin minerals predominantly occur as replacements to the framework minerals,
plagioclase, hornblende, epidote and mica (Fig. 2a). Vermiculite occurs
from the alteration of pre-existing 2:1 biotite. Recasting of the oxide
data (Table 1) into a 2:1 structural formula, results in a vermiculite that
typically results from the alteration of biotite (Schroeder <I>et al</I>.
1997, Murphy <I>et al</I>., 1998). Assuming two-thirds of the ferrous iron
is oxidized to the ferric state, the vermiculite half-unit formula is K<SUB>0.35
</SUB>Mg<SUB>1.21</SUB> Ti<SUB>0.09</SUB> Fe<SUP>3+</SUP><SUB>0.58</SUB>
Fe<SUP>2+</SUP><SUB>0.25</SUB> Al<SUB>0.40 </SUB>Si<SUB>3.00 </SUB>Al<SUB>1.00
</SUB>O<SUB>10</SUB> (OH)<SUB>2</SUB>. The smectitic clays appear as authigenic
pore linings or grain coatings on the skeletal frameworks grains (labeled
as C in Fig 2a). The light olive coloration (5Y 5/3) of the saprolite matrix
is suggestive of a ferroginous smectite. Translocated clay textures were
not observed in C-horizon.</P>

<P>Incipient alteration of the Ti- and Fe- bearing &quot;ilmenite&quot;
phases is apparent in thin-section and by coloration. Clay films bearing
10YR 3/2 coloration are indicative of goethite (Hurst, 1977). Bulk XRD data
also indicate the presence of minor amounts of goethite. Melear and Schroeder
(1999) have documented that incipient goethite formed within the C-horizon
of Piedmont weathering profiles typically contain 10% Al substitution for
Fe (on a molar basis) in the structure. The goethite in the C-horizon can
probably be represented by the formula Al<SUB>0.1</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.9</SUB>OOH.</P>

<P><I>3.4 B-horizon mineralogy</I></P>

<P>This clay-rich horizon is dominated by the kaolin group minerals. <A
HREF="DS3.gif">Figure 3</A> shows this in the X-ray pattern of the clay
fraction, which has small amounts of mixed-layer mica /vermiculite/smectite.
XRD analysis of the bulk material reveals the disappearance of the framework
silicates plagioclase, hornblende, mica and epidote, as well as ilmenite
towards the top of the B horizon. Small redox concretions with reddish 2.5YR
4/6 coloration indicate fine (~1.0 &micro;m) hematite is present (Schwertmann
and Cornell, 1991). Bulk XRD data also indicate the presence of minor amounts
of goethite and hematite. The amount of quartz, relative to the C-horizon
is significantly greater.</P>

<P><I>3.5 A-horizon mineralogy</I></P>

<P>The upper-most horizon features a predominance of quartz, kaolin group
minerals and hydroxy-interlayered-vermiculite. Only a minor amount of gibbsite
was detected in the clay fraction. The HIV is distinctly different from
the expandable mixed-layer clays found deeper in the profile. Figure 3 shows
HIV's signature 14&Aring; reflection. The unheated sample's peak position
does not respond to changes in cation-, hydration- or ethylene glycol-solvation
state. Coloration (5YR 3/2) indicates fine hematite, goethite and organic
matter are present (Hurst, 1977). Bulk XRD data also indicate the presence
of minor amounts of goethite and hematite. Melear and Schroeder (1999) have
documented that incipient goethite formed within the A-horizon of the Piedmont
weathering profiles can contain 30% Al substitution for Fe (on a molar basis)
in the structure. The goethite formed in the A-horizon can probably be represented
by the formula Al<SUB>0.3</SUB>Fe<SUB>0.7</SUB>OOH.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>4. Discussion</B></P>

<P><I>4.1 Mineral reactions</I></P>

<P>Changes in the mineral assemblage observed in the Daniel Springs meta-gabbro
weathering profile are graphically summarized in <A HREF="DS4.gif">figure
4.</A> Quantitative analysis clearly show the chemical breakdown of the
primary minerals andesine, hornblende, biotite, epidote and ilmenite. The
accumulation of secondary minerals, kaolin group, vermiculite, mixed-layer
mica/smectite, hematite and low-Al-goethite at the expense of the primary
minerals is also apparent. The minerals HIV and high-Al-goethite are formed
at the expense of secondary minerals and are characteristic of near-surface
weathering profile throughout the Piedmont (Melear and Schroeder, 1999).
Residual amounts of quartz increase (5-fold the parent rock amount) towards
the surface to the point where it is a dominant primary mineral constituent
in the A- and B-horizons. The fact that gibbsite occurs in only trace amounts
in the Daniel Springs A-horizon, suggests that advective transport factors
are less important than those in A-horizons located on near-by felsic terrains.
This is supported by the observations that gibbsite commonly in occurs A-horizon
of felsic weathering profiles in the Piedmont (Melear and Schroeder, 1999)
and in mafic terrains of the mountainous southern Blue Ridge (Velbel, 1989).</P>

<P><A HREF="DStable2.html">Table 2 </A>contains the major mineral species
observed within the weathering profile, along with their stoichiometries
and relative abundances. The average molar abundances of the elements for
each horizon have been calculated using the data from Table 2 to examine
for net elemental gains and losses (<A HREF="DStable3.html">Table 3</A>).
Whole-rock/soil elemental analysis unfortunately, were not available at
the time of this study and the inaccuracies inherent in XRD quantification
(+/- 5% of the reported values) allow only an assessment of elements that
show large differences.</P>

<P>Table 3 shows that relative to the parent rock, large net losses of Mg,
Ca and K have occurred across each successively higher horizon. Relative
to the parent rock, Al, H and O show net enrichments in the C-horizon and
B-horizon, while they show a small net loss in the A-horizon relative to
the B-horizon. Si abundance shows no real systematic changes between horizons.
The Fe and Ti values in Table 2 are likely subject to quantification errors
and without bulk elemental analysis, any interpretation would be suspect.
It is clear however, that even with rough estimates of the relative oxidation
state of Fe in each phase, the abundance of ferric iron relative to ferrous
iron increases upward in the profile. Using the observations in Tables 2
and 3 we propose a series of simple weathering reactions occurring within
each horizon. These weathering reactions below are similar to those proposed
by Velbel (1989, 1992) and by Murphy et al, (1998).</P>

<P><I>4.2 Reaction fronts at horizons</I></P>

<P>The well-defined horizons in this study allow for a simplified system
that is subdivided into four regions, defined by the parent rock, C-horizon,
B-Horizon and A-horizon. Each subdivision is characterized by the stoichiometry
and abundance of the minerals. Petrographic observations and the relative
mass loss and gain/enrichment of each mineral constituent in each horizon
therefore define the dominant mineral reactions occurring between adjacent
horizons. For example, the mineral assemblage of the parent meta-gabbro
is related to those in the C-horizon by the sum of reactions 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 7 given above. The overall reaction, therefore constitutes the incipient
weathering front, as it moves into the parent rock, which in this case,
involves (a) the dissolution of plagioclase, hornblende, epidote, biotite
and ilmenite, (b) the transformation of biotite to vermiculite and (c) the
precipitation of kaolin group minerals, hematite, low-Al goethite and vermiculite.
Soluble reaction products presumably undergo downward/lateral advective
removal from each horizon. In the case of clays with exchangeable cation
sites, temporary fixing of divalent species (<I>i.e</I>., Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>)
relative to monovalent species via interlayer cation exchange is likely
to be favored. This is supported by the chemical analysis of the vermiculite
after biotite (Table 1). A portion of soluble ions such as K<SUP>+</SUP>
are also known to be retained and cycled in the A- and B-horizons by plant
root metabolic uptake and subsequent release by the bacterial decay of leaves
returned to the forest floor.</P>

<P>Using the stoichiometric and quantitative data from Table 2, <A HREF=
"DStable4.html">Table 4</A> was generated by recasting the mineral abundance
data to an atomic basis (<I>i.e.,</I> mmoles/g of mineral reactant or product).
Included in Table 4 are the net differences for each solid phase in the
parent, C- and B-horizons relative to their overlying horizon. In the cases
where a negative difference is observed, then a minimum material loss has
been assumed. No assumptions therefore, have been made in this study about
using a conservative component (<I>e.g.</I> Ti used by Brimhall and Dietrich,
1987). Positive values of non-preexisting phases represent new mineral growth.
Positive values of preexisting phases could reflect either a concentration
of residual quantities and/or additional precipitated mineral mass. Using
the molar values in Table 4, overall reactions occurring between adjacent
horizons are proposed below. The overall reactions between each set of horizon
pairs are constrained by dissolution of all phases (excluding quartz) in
the underlying horizon using stoichiometries dictated in reactions 1 - 10.
Aqueous species are presumed to be laterally transported away from each
horizon.</P>

<P>The net reaction between the parent and the C-horizon can be generalized
as follows:</P>

<P>63 Plagioclase + 10 hornblende + 6 biotite + 1 epidote + 21 ilmenite
+ 486 H<SUB>2</SUB>O + 213 CO<SUB>2</SUB> + 9 O<SUB>2</SUB> --&gt; 5 vermiculite
+ 59 kaolin + 26 low-Al-goethite + 13 hematite + 4 anatase + 25 Mg<SUP>2+</SUP>
+ 47 Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> + 41 Na<SUP>+</SUP> + 3 K<SUP>+</SUP> +120 H<SUB>4</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>o
</SUP>+ 213 HCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>.</P>

<P>The net reaction between the C-horizon and the B-horizon can be generalized
as follows:</P>

<P>65 Plagioclase + 22 hornblende + 3 biotite + 3 epidote + 16 vermiculite
+ 789 H<SUB>2</SUB>O + 396 CO<SUB>2</SUB> + 13 O<SUB>2</SUB> --&gt; 75 kaolin
+ 53 low-Al-goethite + 2 anatase + 71 Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> + 75 Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>
+ 48 Na<SUP>+</SUP> + 6 K<SUP>+</SUP> +183 H<SUB>4</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>o
</SUP>+ 396 HCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>.</P>

<P>The net reaction between the B-horizon and the A-horizon can be generalized
as follows:</P>

<P>24 Plagioclase + 13 hornblende + 3 epidote + 3 Ilmenite + 2 vermiculite
+ 362 H<SUB>2</SUB>O + 190 CO<SUB>2</SUB> +</P>

<P>7 O<SUB>2</SUB> --&gt; 1 HIV + 34 kaolin + 31 high-Al-goethite + 1 low-Al-goethite
+ 2 hematite + 1 anatase + 33 Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> + 41 Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> + 20
Na<SUP>+</SUP> + 1 K<SUP>+</SUP> + 89 H<SUB>4</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>o
</SUP>+ 190 HCO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>.</P>

<P>The weathering reactions proposed above indicate distinctly different
geochemical environments occur within the profile. This is exemplified by
the changes in the secondary mineral assemblage and the ratios of cations
generated. It is likely the differences are due to infiltration rate and
reactive surface areas (Berner and Berner, 1987). Reactive mineral surface
area of mafic silicates in the C-horizon are related to etch pit formation
(seen in thin-section) and to expandable clay coatings (Figure 3). The net
effect of the clay coating would be to inhibit dissolution. In the B-horizon,
expandable clay coats are disrupted by compaction and bioturbation mechanisms
and lost via dissolution. This then allows for the remaining mafic silicates
to dissolve.</P>

<P>On a molar basis, all the reactions shown above release significant bicarbonate
and silica. The molar ratio of bicarbonate to silica that would be released
from the net reactions in the entire weathering profile has a constant value
of about 2. This ratio is notably 6 times higher than the average composition
of groundwater for the Georgia Piedmont (Railsback <I>et al</I>., 1996).
This suggests that although mafic terrains are potentially significant contributors
of bicarbonate to the groundwater system, their role may not be volumetrically
commensurate to more deeply weathered and more extensive felsic terrains.
A comparison of this mafic mineral assemblage to a nearby, more felsic weathering
profile would help in this analysis. The preponderance of quartz in the
A- and B-horizons and release of dissolved silica would further suggest
that there is not significant quartz dissolution in the C and B horizons,
and perhaps in the special case of poorly-drained mafic terrains in the
Piedmont, quartz abundance could serve a conservative tracer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>5. Conclusions</B></P>

<P>Mineralogical results of a weathering profile developed over a meta-gabbro
reveal the primary minerals plagioclase, hornblende, epidote, biotite, quartz
and ilmenite are present in the saprolite. The minerals plagioclase, hornblende
and epidote are etched and possess clay coatings. Secondary phases in the
saprolite include: randomly-ordered mixed-layer mica/vermiculite/smectite
(90% expandable layer-type with Ca-saturation, 60% expandable with K-saturation),
kaolinite, goethite and vermiculite (after biotite). Plagioclase, amphibole,
vermiculite and ilmenite systematically decrease from the C to the B horizon.
Kaolinite dominates the B horizon clay mineralogy. The near surface, A horizon,
assemblage is characterized by the presence of hydroxy-interlayered-vermiculite,
kaolinite and abundant quartz.</P>

<P>Based on the stoichiometry and abundance of the minerals observed from
the bottom to the top of the weathering profile, relative mineral stabilities
occur in the sequence: plagioclase &lt; biotite &lt; hornblende &lt; ilmenite
&lt; epidote &lt; mixed-layer mica/vermiculite/smectite &lt; vermiculite
&lt; low-Al goethite &lt; kaolin minerals &lt; quartz &lt; hematite &lt;
high-Al goethite &lt; HIV. The relative production of bicarbonate to silica,
based on mass loss estimates in the mineral assemblage, is six times higher
than the bicarbonate to silica ratio regionally observed in groundwaters
of the Georgia Piedmont. A proposed parallel study from a nearby, equivalent
landscape, whose parent material is felsic in composition, in addition to
a more detailed aerial estimate of mafic and felsic terrains should provide
a basis for comparing the relative rates of felsic silicate weathering versus
mafic silicate weathering in temperate climates.</P>
