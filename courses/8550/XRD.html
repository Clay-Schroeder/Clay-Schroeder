    <h3><font face="Times">Detector deadtime</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Times">When the measured count rate is not directly
        proportional to the photon rate entering the detector, the
        detector response is non-linear and said to have deadtime. The
        effect is to increase the relative intensity of the weaker
        peaks. Most modern detectors (with calibration and computer
        correction) handle count rates up to 100,000 counts per second
        (cps). A quick check to determine if the detector not responding
        in a linear fashion is to measure the intensity of the strongest
        line with the tube current set for the normal quantitation.
        Perform the measurement a second time at half the tube current.
        If the second measurement is more than half the first then
        detector deadtime is the probable cause. In this latter case the
        detector correction routing must be recalibrated or the observed
        data must be corrected accordingly.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times"><b>Counting Statistics</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">The precision of intensity data can be limited
        more by counting statistics than any other single parameter
        except preferred orientation. The figure below illustrates how
        the probable error of peak intensity measurements can vary with
        both the total number of counts and the ratio of the peak to
        background counting rate (R).</font></p>
    <center><font face="Times"><img src="countingstats.gif"
          naturalsizeflag="0" height="371" width="367" align="bottom"></font></center>
    <p><font face="Times">Both the total number of counts and R depend
        upon scan rate and chopper increment. For a chopper increment of
        0.01∞ and scan rate of 2∞ 2&#952;<font face="Times"> min<sup>-1</sup>,
          the count time per increment is only 0.3 s. If the counting
          rate at the peak top is 1000 cps, then the total number of
          counts is 300. If R is large, then the best precision
          attainable is about <u>+</u>5%. If R is 1.5, then probable
          error exceeds <u>+</u>10%. By decreasing the scan rate of
          0.2∞ 2</font>&#952;<font face="Times"> min<sup>-1</sup>, probable
          error drops to <u>+</u>4%.</font></font></p>

    <center><font face="Times">&nbsp;</font></center>
    <p><font face="Times">Further improvement in peak intensity
        precision is possible by smoothing over the peak top in small
        increments and also averaging background over hundreds of
        increments on both sides of a peak.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times"><b>Sample displacement</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Displacement of the sample off the
        diffractometer focusing circle can be brought about in three
        ways. Firstly, there is instrumental misalignment. Often
        neglected is the tacit assumption that the goniometer is
        properly aligned before any experiment is run. This can be
        easily maintained with a proper alignment using manufacturer
        provided tools and checking with a standard material such as the
        <a href="SRM_XRD.pdf">U.S. National Institute of Standards and
          Technology Reference Materials</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">If the sample holder is properly aligned then
        the second potential source of displacement error comes from way
        the sample itself is packed into the sample holder (see next
        section).The figure below shows the changes in measured
        d-spacings for a series of reflections as a function of
        displacement from the goniometer focal plane.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Times"><img
          src="displacement.gif" naturalsizeflag="0" height="152"
          width="465" align="bottom"> </font></div>
    <p><font face="Times">Displacement error increases rapidly as 2&#952;<font
          face="Times"> falls below 20∞ as see in the figure below.</font></font></p>
    <center><font face="Times"><img src="displacement2.gif"
          align="bottom"></font></center>
    <p><font face="Times">Equally important is the decrease in
        diffraction intensity with increasing displacement. Finally,
        effective displacement or sample transparency can be a
        consequence of a low mass absorption coefficient (µ) or high
        sample porosity (see next section).</font></p>

            orientation</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times"><font face="Times">The XRD powder method
          relies on principle that all possible crystallographic
          orientations are presented to the beam. This concept is known
          a random orientation. If there is a bias of orientations of
          one or more particular crystallographic plane, then this is
          known a preferred orientation. Preferred orientation is likely
          the most common cause of intensity variations in XRD powder
          experiments.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">Particles with perfect cleavage or acicular
        shapes, such as clay minerals, are the most prone to preferred
        orientation. Intensity variations up to 100% are possible. Here
        are some tips to minimize the effects of preferred orientation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">a. Be consistent with sample mounting and
        packing methods. Sprinkling and backpacking may reduce preferred
        orientation. Apply a constant pressure (e.g. 200 psi for 20 s).</font></p>
    <center><font face="Times"><img src="mount.gif" naturalsizeflag="0"

    <p><font face="Times">b. Reduce the particle size of the material to
        about 5 to 10 µm. This also minimized primary and secondary
        extinction effects. Using a wet grinding method reduces defects.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">c. Mix the sample with 20% internal standard.
        Pick an internal standard that has equant particles and that
        does not interfere with the peaks of interest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times">d. Slurry mounting with acetone can minimized
        preferred orientation. Water is a polar compound, where as
        acetone is less polar and it evaporates quickly. If particles
        are kept away from each other while drying, then van der waal
        forces will not let them to attract to each other and self
        align. The pitfall of slurry mounting is that the sample may be

        enough to prevent the beam from passing through to the substrate

        about 1/1000th of the initial beam intensity. This condition is
        termed "infinite thickness".</font></p>

          with different porosity. </li>
        <li>Thickness of the sample. Sometimes you just don't have
          enough material to pack your holder. Using a "zero-background"
          plate minimizes scatter from the substrate. A common
          zero-background plate is a quartz crystal cut and polished 6∞
          of the <i>c</i>-axis. </li>
        <li>Porosity of the sample. This is minimized by good sample
          packing. If the sample is porous and thin, then the higher
          order (angle) reflections will be compromised. </li>

    <p><b>Peak finding.</b> </p>
    <p>There are various degrees of sophistication for determining peak
      properties. In increasing order of time and effort are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>1. Graphically picking peak intensity and positions with a cursor
      on the computer screen or print out the peak and use a ruler. </p>
    <p>2. Second-derivative peak finding routine.&nbsp; The first
      derivative of a peak gives the peak position and the second
      derivative gives the peak width. </p>
    <p>3. Profile fitting. There are several models that can be used to
      fit peak data. A good reference is by Howard, S.A. and K.D.
      Preston (1989) Profile fitting of powder diffraction patterns. in
      Modern Powder Diffraction eds. D.L. Bish and J.E. Post, Reviews in
      Mineralogy, v. 20, p. 215-275. </p>
    <p>4. Rietveld refinement. This is a full pattern approach (beyond
      the scope of these course notes).&nbsp; See Post, J.E.&nbsp; and
      D.L. Bish (1989) Rietveld refinement of crystal structures using
      powder X-ray diffraction data. in Modern Powder Diffraction eds.
