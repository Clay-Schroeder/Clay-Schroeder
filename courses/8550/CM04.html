      </font><span style="font-style: italic;">The essential feature for
        all diffraction phenomena is that the wavelength of the wave is
        about the same as the distance between the scattering points
        through which the waves are traveling</span>.</p>
    <p>What are typical inter-planar distances in a clay mineral?
      Answer: Can range from 0.1 to 50 Å (0.01 to 5 nm)<br>
    </p>
    <p>What is the range of wavelength for X-rays? <a
        href="Bearden1967.pdf">Answer</a>: Ranges from 0.1 to 100 Å
      (0.01 to 10 nm)<br>
    </p>
    <p>So it is a coincidence that we use X-rays for diffraction studies
      of crystalline material?<br>
    </p>
    There are two theoretical approaches to the study of X-ray
    diffraction. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kinematic theory</span>
    considers scattering from each atom is independent of all other
    atoms and once scattered and the X-rays pass beyond without further
    scattering. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamical theory</span>
    takes into account all the wave interactions within a crystal. In
    other words, the total electromagnetic field is considered in
    dynamic theory because the incident and diffracted beams swap energy
    back and forth. Dynamic theory must be employed if a large single
    crystals involved, because the scattered beam may be re-scattered to
    recombine again with the primary beam. As it turns out for fine
    crystal powders such as clay minerals, the underlying assumptions
    for kinematic theory can explain most of the observed phenomenon. We
    will therefore focus of our kinematic theory for our discussions. <br>
    <p><b>Coherent Scattering</b></p>
    <p>When X-rays encounter electrons they are scattered....</p>
    <ul>
      <li>by the nature of the electron structure that surrounds the
        atom.</li>
      <li>by the thermal vibration of the atom center.</li>
      <li>by the arrangement of atoms in the unit cell. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Electromagnetic radiation (EM) has vector properties with a <b>ray</b>
      path defined as the direction of EM propagation.</p>
    <p>As with all electromagnetic radiation there is an electric <b>E
      </b>component vibrating perpendicular to the ray and a magnetic <b>H</b>
      vector perpendicular to the electric vector.</p>
    <p>The electric component interacts with the electrons of the atoms,
      vibrating in resonance, essentially absorbing and re-emitting the
      same frequency radiation in all directions.</p>
    <p><img src="scatterpoint.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" width="426"
        height="286" align="bottom"></p>
    <p>The electrons around the nucleus do the scattering, therefore the
      scattering power of an atom increases with the number of electrons
      bound to the atom.</p>
    <p>The scattering power is not exactly proportional to the number of
      electrons, because as the number of electrons increase some
      destructive interference occurs. In other words, electrons are not
      all in the same place and there is a phase shift.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Interference</b></p>

    <p>A diffracted beam is a beam that results from a great number of
      constructively interfered wave fronts. The two waves in the
      diagram above have path-length-difference of 1/4 of the
      wavelength.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Click <a href="additionoftwowaves.xls">here</a> to download a
      simple Excel spreadsheet that allows you to add two waves of equal
      wavelength together.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What condition allows for numerous wave fronts to come together
      in a constructive way?</p>
    <p><b>Scattering from a row of atoms.</b></p>
    <p><img src="scatterrow.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" width="438"
        height="188" align="bottom"></p>
    <p>Regularly spaced scattering centers (i.e., atoms) result in the <b>constructive</b>
      interference at specific points in space and <b>destructive</b>
      interference in all other points in space.</p>
    <p>Note the <b>points</b> of constructive interference in the above
      figure</p>
    <p><b>Wave fronts</b> of constructive interference result.</p>
    <p>These fronts form <b>cones</b> of constructive interference.</p>
    <p><img src="scattercones.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" width="462"
        height="237" align="bottom"></p>
    <p>Where cones intersect in 3-dimensions, further constructive
      interference occurs.</p>
    <p></p>
    <hr align="left"><b>Bragg's Law</b>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Scattering from a three dimensional crystal structure</b></p>
    <p>Until now we have only considered a single row of atoms. We know
      that atoms in a crystal lattice are arranged in an orderly three
      dimension array. For each linear set of scattering atoms (row)
      there is a set of diffraction cones that emanate from atom
      centers. The places where the cones coincide (i.e., constructively
      interfere) occur under unique geometric conditions.</p>
    <p>If we consider an incident beam approaching scattering centers at
      some angle (&#952;), it can be shown that the only place the scattered
      beam will be in phase is at the same or "reflected" angle that
      leaves the scattering points.</p>
    <p><img src="Bragg.gif" naturalsizeflag="3" width="640" height="545"
        align="bottom"></p>
    <p>Geometrically, the conditions of constructive interference are
      met only when <span style="font-weight: bold;">DC</span> = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">CE</span> therefore, &#952; = &#952;' and <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">AC</span> = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">DC</span> sin&#952;.</p>
    <p>Under these conditions there is zero path length difference
      between rays 1 and 2.</p>
    <p>Unlike light, which can be reflected at all angles, X-rays are
      "reflected" only at specific angles.</p>
    <p>The wave fronts that pass through a crystal must have
      path-length-differences exactly 1,2,3...n integers away or they
      will destructively interfere.</p>
    <p>Compare Rays 1 and 3.</p>
    <p>Note path length difference into the plane of atoms is the
      distance <span style="font-weight: bold;">FB</span> + <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">BG</span>.</p>
    <p>This additional distance must be equal to some integer distance
      (i.e., <span style="font-weight: bold;">FB</span> + <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">BG</span> = n&#955;), but it does not.</p>
    <p>Note that the distance <span style="font-weight: bold;">AC </span>is
the

      inter-planar d-spacing.</p>
    <p>Under "reflecting" conditions then &#952; = &#952;' and sin &#952; = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">AC</span> / <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">DC</span> and sin &#952;' = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">AE</span> / <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">CE</span></p>
    <p>Let: <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span> = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">AC</span> and n&#955; = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">DC</span> + <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">CE</span></p>
    <p>then: 2<span style="font-weight: bold;">AC</span> sin &#952; = <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">DC </span>+<span style="font-weight:
        bold;"> CE</span> or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><big><b>n&#955; =
            2<span style="font-style: italic;">d </span>sin&#952;</b></big></big>
