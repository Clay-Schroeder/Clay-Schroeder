Order implies repetition in space (i.e., found in intervals of equaldistance).</p>  <p><b>Motif - </b>the unit of pattern (e.g., the flower repeated on wallpaper or wrapping paper design). In two dimensional space, it is easy tothink of the translation of an object in a pattern in any X and Y direction.</p>  <h3 align="center"><hr>2-dimensional symmetry (Plane Groups)</h3>  <p><i>Examples</i>: <b>2-D square lattice</b>. To translate a motif (thesnail) in space we employ rules of symmetry.</p>  <p><b>Rules of symmetry</b> are the way we describe the orderly repetitionof a motif in space. In the 2-D example of a square or isoclinic plane lattice,we use the rule or <b>geometric operation</b> of a <b>translation </b>tomove the snail an equal distance in an XY coordinate system. The coordinatesystem is defined by increments whose unit lengths (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>)are equal and whose axes are at right angles to each other (. The Cartesiancoordinate system is a square lattice whose unit lengths are equal to one (<font face="Symbol">g</font> = 90&deg;).</p>  <p>Points or nodes connecting each other collectively form a net that iscalled a <b>lattice</b>.</p>  <p>Square or Isoclinic (<i>a = b, </i><font face="Symbol">g</font> = 90&deg;)</p>  <p align="center"><img src="square.gif" width="334" height="368" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></p>  <p>The area (or volume in the case of 3-D) that comprises the unit length'sdistances between lattice points is known as the <b>unit cell</b>.</p>  <p>The <b>primitive</b> (<i>p</i>) unit cell is that which contains nodesonly at the corners of the unit cell and has the smallest possible repeatdistance that can be translated along the x and y directions to produce theentire pattern.</p>  <p></p><hr align="left"><b>Rectangular lattice:</b> Unit lengths along x and y donot necessarily need to be of equal lengths.<p></p>  <p>Orthoclinic (<i>a</i> not equal to <i>b</i>, <i><font face="Symbol">g</font> = </i>90&deg;)</p>  <p align="center"><img src="rectangularlattice.gif" width="436" height="337" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></p>  <p></p><hr align="left"><b>Oblique lattice:</b> The angles between the axes do notintersect at right angles.

A primitive latticemay also be described as a rectangular lattice with a <b>centered</b> (<i>c</i>)unit cell. The reason for chosing the convention of a non-primative unitcell is to enable description of pattern using higher symmetry operations(more on this later).</p>  <p align="center"><img src="retangularcenteredlattice.gif" width="305" height="442" align="bottom" naturalsizeflag="3"></p>  <h3 align="center"><hr>Symmetry elements without translations.</h3>  <p><b>Symmetry element</b> - locus of points or point that aid visualizingthe symmetrical repeat of a motif.</p>  <p><b>Symmetry operation</b> - is the act of moving the motif about the element.</p>  <p>One type of a geometric operation that reproduces a motif is a <b>rotation</b>.The object is to create a pattern by moving the motif about an imaginaryaxis through some angle ( <font face="Symbol">a</font>). The axis is theelement and rotation is the operation.</p>  <p>The amount of rotational symmetry is designated by an integer (n) from1 to infinity. n is defined by 360&deg; divided by the number of rotationaldegrees in the operation. Remember, you must return to the original positionof the motif.</p>  <p>A good example can be seen by viewing a <a href="beercans.gif">beer can</a>.The bottom appears with an infinte amount of rotational symmetry while thetop view appears to have an n equal to one.</p>  <p>Because of geometrical constraints (all the polyhedron must be space occupied)the internal order of a crystal is limited to 1-fold, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-foldaxis (<i>i.e.</i>, n = 1,2,3,4 or 6).</p>  <p align="center"></p><hr><b>Notation for rotation operations</b><p></p>  <p align="center"><a href="rotsymbols.jpeg"><img src="rotsymbols.jpeg" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="4" alt="[inlinified image]" align="bottom" width="224" naturalsizeflag="1"></a><br> </p>  <p>An example of a <a href="4foldrotation.jpeg">4-fold rotation operationis given here</a></p>  <p></p><hr align="left">Other symmetry operations include the creation of new patternthrough a <b>mirror</b> plane image (<i>m</i>).<p></p>  <p>The example below combines two operations, including a mirror plane reflectionand a translation that is known as a glide plane translation (<i>g</i>).The elements for a glide symmetry (a plane and an axis in this case) mustoccupy a common place in 3-D space.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="glideplane.jpeg"><img src="glideplane.jpeg" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="4" alt="[inlinified image]" align="bottom" width="123" naturalsizeflag="1"></a><br> </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p></p><hr align="left">An <b>inversion</b> (<i>i</i>) operation goes through animaginary point or inversion center.<p></p>  <p align="center"><a href="inversion.jpeg"><img src="inversion.jpeg" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="4" alt="[inlinified image]" align="bottom" width="146" naturalsizeflag="1"></a><br> <br> </p><hr><p></p>  <p>Operations and element without translations are summarized below</p>  <p><b>Symmetry operations - </b>rotation, reflection and inversion</p>  <p><b>Symmetry elements</b> - rotation axis, mirror plane (m) and symmetrycenter (i)  </p><br></body></html>
