<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Crystal Habit</FONT> </B>-
Outward appearance of a crystal that reflects the manner in which
the mineral has grown. A crystal's habit is, in part, related
to the internal structure of the mineral, but also the conditions
of crystal growth.</P>

<P>The terms below are commonly used to describe the general appearance
of a crystal.</P>

<P><I>Euhedral </I>- well formed faces</P>

<P><I>Subhedral </I>- Imperfectly formed faces</P>

<P><I>Anhedral</I> - Without faces</P>

<P>There are many more terms that are used (some common.... some
esoteric) to describe the outward appearance of a crystal.</P>

<P><I>e.g.</I>, Bladed, fibrous, boytrioidal, etc.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Cleavage</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+2"> </FONT>-
Tendency to break or split along definite planes to produce a
smooth surface. The cleavage quality and the number of cleavage
directions is related to the internal arrangement of atoms in
the crystalline structure and the type chemical bonding between
the atoms in the mineral.</P>

<P>If a mineral has &quot;perfect&quot; cleavage, then this means
it breaks along a smooth, parallel surface.</P>

<P>If a mineral has &quot;imperfect&quot; cleavage, then this
means it breaks along a rough, parallel surface.</P>

<P>If a mineral has &quot;poor&quot; cleavage, then this means
it breaks along an irregular surface.</P>

<P>Some minerals exhibit more than one direction of cleavage and
therefore, the number of cleavage directions and the angle(s)
between the cleavage planes can be very diagnostic.</P>

<P><I>e.g.,</I> Halite - 3 directions of perfect cleavage at 90&deg;
angles.</P>

<P><A HREF="fluorite2.gif">Fluorite</A>
- 4 directions of perfect cleavage</P>

<P>Micas - 1 direction of perfect cleavage.</P>

<P><B>Caution!</B> The size of a crystal is an important factor
in understanding all of the above. Often times, crystal sizes
are small (40 &micro;m is about the practical limit of hand lens
resolution), therefore, these specimens display a <I>massive</I>
appearance (<I>i.e.</I>, composed of many tiny crystals).</P>

<P><A HREF="kao.jpeg">Kaolinite</A>
is a mica-like mineral with 1 direction of perfect cleavage. Kaolinite
crystals however, rarely grow to be larger than 5 &micro;m. Kaolinite
cleavage is something you'll never see with a hand lens.</P>

<P>1 &micro;m = one millionth of meter = 0.000001 m = 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
m</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Specific gravity</FONT></B> - A measure
of the density of a mineral. Defined by the ratio of the weight
of the material in air to an equal volume of water.</P>

<P>Designated by <B>G</B> in systematic mineralogy.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="G.gif"
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> where, Wa = weight in air, Ww - weight in water.</P>

<P>Density versus specific gravity: Remember <B>G</B> is a ratio
and therefore has no units. Density (<FONT FACE="Symbol">r</FONT>)
has units of mass per unit volume (typically g/cm<sup>3</sup>).
Numerically <FONT FACE="Symbol">r</FONT> and <B>G</B> are the
same because we choose to define density using water (<I>i..e.</I>,
1 g = 1 cm<sup>3</sup> water).</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Color</FONT></B> - Color results from the
interaction of light (a small protion of the <A HREF="emspectrum.jpeg">electro
magnetic spectrum</A>) with matter (mostly electrons). When incident
light bombars a mineral it can do one of several things, including:</P>

<P>Reflection</P>

<P>Refraction - coherent scattering</P>

<P>Scattering - incoherent scattering</P>

<P>Absroption - caused by interaction with electrons (the color
we see is what is not absorbed).</P>

<P>Fluorescence - emittance of photons as electrons fall back
to lower energy states.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="lightinteractions.gif"
ALIGN="MIDDLE"></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+3">Causes of color</FONT></P>

<P><B>Electron Transitions</B></P>

<P>From the study of the electromagnetic spectrum we know that
the energy (E) of light (or any other portion of the spectrum)
is related to the frequency of radiation by Planck's constant.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="deltaE.jpeg"
ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<P>As light impinges on the outer electrons of certain elements,
the electrons undergo an energy transiton. These transitions or
changes in energy (<FONT FACE="Symbol">D</FONT>E) are quantum
(<I>i.e.</I>, transitions occur with discrete amounts of energy).</P>

<P>The frequency of these transitions correspond with the frequencies
of color in the <A HREF="emspectrum.jpeg">EM
spectrum</A>. This most commonly occurs with transitions of electrons
in the 3<I>d</I> orbital of the <A HREF="http://www2.shef.ac.uk/chemistry/web-elements/xtal/periodic-table.html">transition
elements</A> (e.g., Ti, Cr, V, Fe...)</P>

<P>Electron transitions that occur in the &quot;color range&quot;
are classified into three groups based on the electronic phenomenon
causing the transition. These include (1) Crystal field transitions,
(2) Molecular orbital transitions and (3) Color centers. Each
are briefly discussed below.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="+2">Crystal Field Transitions</FONT>
-</P>

<P>The 3<I>d</I> orbitals of transition elements in the free ionic
(gaseous) state have 5 degenerate (same) energy states. If the
free ion is placed in proximity to a spherical negative charge
(<I>i.e.</I>, nearing electrons), then total energy of the ion
increases. If the ion is in crystal structure, then the interaction
of the electron clouds of the ion will inteact with the electron
clouds of the coordinating anion polyhedron. The nature of the
interactions are highly dependent upon (1) the number of d electrons,
(2) the coordination number or the number of anions surrounding
the cation, (3) the distance between the cation and anions or
distortion of the polyhedron and (4) the orienation of the particular
d orbital to coordinating polyhdedron.</P>

<P>The example below shows a <I>d<sub>x</sub><FONT SIZE="-1">2-</FONT><sub>y</sub><FONT
 SIZE="-1">2 </FONT></I>orbital postioned in octahedral coordination.
The effect is to raise the energy level of the electron energy
state because the clouds are directly opposite the anion ligand.
The effect of the<I> d<sub>xy</sub></I> orbital would be to decrease
its energy level because it is located between the anion ligand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Examples:</P>

<P><B>Idiochromatic</B> (major intrinsic element)</P>

<P><A HREF="fayalite2.gif">Olivine</A>
Fe2+ in octahderal coordination - Green color.</P>

<P>Garnet Fe2+ in cubic coordination - Red color</P>

<P><B>Allochromatic</B> (minor intrinsic element)</P>

<P>Beryl Cr3+ replaces Al3+ in octahedral coordination (shared
w/ silicate tetrahedra) - emerald</P>

<P>Corundum Cr3+ replaces Al3+ in octahedral coordination (non-shared)
- ruby</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="+2">Molecular Orbital Transitions</FONT>
-</P>

<P>Known as charge transfer transitions. The valance electrons
shared between molecular structures and the energy change associated
with this &quot;hopping process are in the range of light.</P>

<P>Examples include metal to metal transfers such as Fe2+ --&gt;
Fe3+ between to sites.</P>

<P>Magnetite is black due to idiochromatic electron charge transfers.</P>

<P>Blue sapphire (corundum) and kyanite results from Ti4+ and
Fe2+ substitution for 2 Al3+. The electron hopping between Fe2+
---&gt; Ti4+ causes absorption of red, therefore leading the blue
colors.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="+2">Color Center Transitions</FONT>
- Trapped electrons (required for charge balance in a mineral
structure defect) vibrate with quantitized energy that interact
with light photons.</P>

<P>Examples include missing F- ions in fluorite defects (see below)
which makes purple color. Coupled substitution of Al3+ and Na+
for Si in the commonly occurs a trace levels in the quartz structure.
Irradiation of <A HREF="quartz1.gif">quartz</A>
makes electron in tetrhedrally coordinated Al3+ susceptible to
relocation and trapping elsewhere in the crystal. This produces
smokey <A HREF="quartz1.gif">quartz</A>.</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE="+2">Other Causes of Color</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Play of Colors.</FONT></P>

<P>Interference of light at the surface of a mineral as the angle
of incidence changes is known as a <I>play of colors.</I> Light
will diffract as it passes through regularly spaced mineral boundaries.
The wavelength of light that is diffracted from a white light
source is related to angle of incidence and the spacing between
the diffraction grating. Diffraction theory will be covered in
more detail in lecture</P>

<P>Examples include:</P>

<P>Opal which is composed of hexagonally closest packed hydrated-silica
spheres.</P>

<P>Labradorite which is composed of altrenating lamellae of different
composition plagioclase felspars.</P>

<P>Closely spaced fracture planes, cleavage planes and twinning
planes may also cause a play of colors.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Mixture of a finely-dispersed minor impurity
phase with a host mineral.</FONT></P>

<P>Examples include:</P>

<P>Hematite finely dispersed in quartz - jasper</P>

<P>Watch out in field situations when some minerals appear<FONT
 COLOR="#187534"> green</FONT>. This is many times, due to algae
which loves to grow on wet rock surfaces.</P>
