This polytype is commonin nature.</P><P><IMG SRC="1M.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>2M<sub>1</sub> polytypes involve a +120&deg; rotationfollowed by a -120&deg; rotation.. This makes a two-layer monoclinic unitcell. This is common in the diocathedral structures (<I>e.g</I>., muscoviteand illite).</P><P><IMG SRC="2M1.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>2M<sub>2</sub> polytypes involve a +60&deg; rotation followedby a -60&deg; rotation.. This makes a two-layer monoclinic unit cell. Thisis uncommon in nature, but seen in lepidolites and phengites.</P><P><IMG SRC="2M2.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>3T polytypes involve a +120&deg; rotation followed byanother +120&deg; rotation. This makes a three-layer Trigonal unit cell.This is common in both the di- and trioctahedral structures (<I>e.g</I>.,muscovite and illite). Another polytype involves a -120&deg; rotation followedby another -120&deg; rotation.. These polytypes are, by definition, enatiomorphsand X-ray diffraction does not easily distinguish the two types.</P><P><IMG SRC="3T.gif" WIDTH="205" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></BODY></HTML>
