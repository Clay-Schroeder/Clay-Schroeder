    <h3>Crystallography: Miller Indices</h3>
    <p>Recall our discussion about the likelihood of developing a
      particular
      crystal face is, in part, related to the density of lattice nodes
      (and in
      part to the rate at which a crystal grows).</p>
    <p>Many times we wish to discuss a particular crystal face or more
      importantly, a particular plane of atoms within the crystal
      lattice structure. To do
      this, a universally accepted system of indices has been developed
      to describe
      the orientation of crystallographic planes and crystal faces
      relative to
      crystallographic axes. This convention is called the system of
      Miller indices.</p>
    <p><b>Miller Indices</b> are a symbolic vector representation for
      the orientation of an atomic plane in a crystal lattice and are
      defined as the reciprocals of the fractional intercepts which the
      plane makes with the crystallographic axes.</p>
    <p>The method by which indices are determined is best shown by
      example. Recall, that there are three axes in crystallographic
      systems (*sometimes in the
      hexagonal system adopts a convention where there are four axes).
      Miller indices
      are represented by a set of 3 integer numbers.</p>
    <p>Example of the (111) plane:</p>
    <p><a href="111.jpeg"><img src="111.jpeg" naturalsizeflag="0"
          align="bottom" height="349" width="275"> </a></p>
    <p>If you want to describe the orientation of a crystal face or a
      plane of atoms within a crystal lattice, then there are series of
      steps that will
      lead you to its notation using Miller indices.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first step is to determine the fractional intercepts that
        the plane/face makes with each crystallographic axis. In other
        words,
        how far along the unit cell lengths does the plane intersect the
        axis.
        In the<a href="111.jpeg"> figure above</a>, the plane intercepts
        each axis
        at exact one unit length. </li>
      <li>Step two involves taking the reciprocal of the fractional
        intercept of each unit length for each axis. In the <a
          href="111.jpeg">figure above</a>, the values are all 1/1. </li>
      <li>Finally the fractions are cleared (<i>i.e.,</i> make 1 as the
        common denominator). The cleared fractions result in 3 integer
        values. These
        integers are designated <i>h, k</i> and<i> l.</i> </li>
      <li>These integer numbers are then parenthetically enclosed <i>(hkl)

        </i>to indicate the specific crystallographic plane within the
        lattice. Since the unit cell repeats in space, the <i>(hkl) </i>notation
        actually represents a family of planes, all with the same
        orientation. In the <a href="111.jpeg">figure above</a>, the
        Miller indices for the plane are (111). </li>
    </ol>
    <hr align="left">Why go through all of these reciprocal operations?
    <p>Example of the (101) plane:</p>
    <p><a href="101.jpeg"><img src="101.jpeg" naturalsizeflag="0"
          align="bottom" height="336" hspace="5" vspace="4" width="241">
      </a></p>
    <p>This becomes immediately apparent when we consider the <a
        href="101.jpeg">case of the (101)</a>. In this case, the plane
      intercepts the <i>a</i> axis at one unit length and also the <i>c</i>
      axis at one unit length. The plane however, never intersects the <i>b
      </i>axis. In other
      words, it can be said that the intercept to the <i>b </i>axis is
      infinity.
      The intercepts are then designated as 1,infinity,1. The
      reciprocals are
      then 1/1, 1/infinity, 1/1. Knowing 1/infinity = 0 then the indices
      become
      (101).</p>

    <p><a href="102.jpeg"><img src="102.jpeg" naturalsizeflag="0"
          align="bottom" height="320" hspace="5" vspace="4" width="246">
      </a></p>
    <hr align="left">Example of the (-102) plane:

    <h3>Bravais-Miller Indices</h3>
    <br>
    The crystals that belong to the hexagonal system can be viewed as
    having either a 6-fold or 3-fold &nbsp;rotational symmetry axis.
    &nbsp;One approach to viewing the symmetry content of the hexagonal
    system is to assign a set of three identical axes (<i>a<sub>1</sub>,
      a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub></i>) that are perpendicular to a
    plane that contains the three axes. This alternate form of
    describing the hexagaonal system with four crystallographic axes
    is known as the Bravais-Miller system. The symbolic notation for
    this system is given as (<i>hkil</i>), where the first three
    integers refer to the three identical axes, respectively. <br>
    <br>
    In this notation, h + k = - i <br>

    <h3>Closures for crystallographic indices</h3>
    <p>(<i>hkl</i>) = parenthesis designate a <b>crystal face</b> or a
      <b>family of planes</b> throughout a crystal lattice.</p>
    <p>[<i>uvw</i>] = square brackets designate a direction in the
      lattice from the origin to a point. Used to collectively include
      all the faces of a crystals whose intersects (i.e., edges)
      parallel each other. These are referred to as crystallographic <b>zones</b>
      and they represent a direction in the crystal lattice.</p>
    <p>{<i>hkl</i>} = "squiggly" brackets or braces designate a set of
      faces
      that are equivalent by the symmetry of the crystal. The set of
      face planes
      results in the <b>crystal form</b>. {100} in the isometric class
      includes
      (100), (010), (001), (-100), (0-10) and (00-1), while for the
      triclinic {100}
      only the (100) is included.</p>
    <p><b>d-spacing</b> is defined as the distance between adjacent
      planes. When X-rays diffract due to interference amongst a family
      of similar atomic planes, then each diffraction plane may be
      reference by it's indices d<i><sub>hkl</sub></i> </p>
