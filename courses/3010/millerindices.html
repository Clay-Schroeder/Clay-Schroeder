The first thing that must be acertained are the fractional interceptsthat the plane/face makes with the crystallographic axes. In other words,how far along the unit cell lengths does the plane intersect the axis. Inthe<A HREF="111.jpeg"> figure above</A>, the plane intercepts each axisat exact one unit length.</P><P>2. Step two involves taking the reciprocal of the fractional interceptof each unit length for each axis. In the <A HREF="111.jpeg">figure above</A>,the values are all 1/1.</P><P>3. Finally the fractions are cleared (<I>i.e.,</I> make 1 as the commondenominator).</P><P>4. These integer numbers are then parenthetically enclosed and designatethat specific crystallographic plane within the lattice. Since the unitcell repeats in space, the notation actually represents a family of planes,all with the same orientation. In the <A HREF="111.jpeg">figure above</A>,the Miller indice for the plane is (111)</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Why go through all of these operations?</P><P>Example of the (101) plane:</P><P><A HREF="111.jpeg"><IMG SRC="101.jpeg" HEIGHT="80" hspace="5" vspace="4"WIDTH="58" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </A></P><P>This becomes immediately apparent when we consider the <A HREF="101.jpeg">caseof the (101)</A>. In this case the plane intercepts the <I>a</I> axis atone unit length and also the <I>c</I> axis at one unit length. The planehowever, never intersects the <I>b </I>axis. In other words, it can be saidthat the intercept to the <I>b </I>axis is infinity. The intercepts arethen designated as 1,infinity,1. The reciprocals are then 1/2, 1/infinity,1/1. Knowing 1/infinity = 0 then the indices become (101).</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Look at worked examples for the (010) and (201) and (bar-201).</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Example of the (101) plane:</P><P><A HREF="101.jpeg"><IMG SRC="101.jpeg" HEIGHT="67" hspace="5" vspace="4"WIDTH="48" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Example of the (102) plane:</P><P><A HREF="102.jpeg"><IMG SRC="102.jpeg" HEIGHT="73" hspace="5" vspace="4"WIDTH="56" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Example of the (-102) plane:</P><P><A HREF="bar102.jpeg"><IMG SRC="bar102.jpeg" HEIGHT="68" hspace="5" vspace="4" WIDTH="52" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Examples of the (102) and (201) planes:</P><P><A HREF="102201.jpeg"><IMG SRC="102201.jpeg" HEIGHT="79" hspace="5" vspace="4" WIDTH="74" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </A></P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P><H3>Closures for crystallographics indices</H3><P>(<I>hkl</I>) = parenthesis designate a <B>crystal face</B> or a <B>familyof planes</B> throughout a crystal lattice.</P><P>[<I>hkl</I>] = square barackets designate a direction in the latticefrom the origin to a point.
