    <p><b>Mineral Thermodynamics - </b>This is a prelude to mineral
      associations. In your studies of systematic mineralogy you have
      been noting the occurrence of minerals. Information supplied in
      this section of your mineral log book should include the locations
      and associated mineral assemblage (i.e., other minerals commonly
      found together).<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Rock</b> - defined as an aggregate of one or more mineral. The
      study of rocks is known as petrology. Petrology includes the
      identification of minerals and their associated textures (size and
      shapes) and abundance. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The information derived from petrology is used to understand the
      origin of formation of the rock. So, not only does a petrologist
      need to be a mineralogist (for identification purposes), but
      she/he must also be a geochemist to know something about
      conditions under which minerals undergo reaction or change .<br>
    </p>
    <p>Minerals form or disappear in response to changes in specific
      physical and chemical conditions. The role of the petrologist or
      geochemist is to determine the history of those changes in
      conditions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Geochemistry entails the study of a wide range of geologic
      environments in which minerals form. For example, these include
      the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>waters of lakes and oceans </li>
      <li>metals in ore deposits </li>
      <li>gases in volcanoes </li>
      <li>fluid phases in magma </li>
      <li>soils in the weathering profiles </li>
      <li>organic matter in sedimentary rocks </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With basic knowledge from our studies of physical chemistry, it
      is possible to describe the nature of a mineral phase under
      certain physical conditions. The subdisciplines that provide us
      with the tools to reconstruct the physical and chemical origins of
      geological systems include the fields of <b>thermodynamics,
        kinetics and quantum mechanics.<br>
      </b></p>
    <p>Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations. <br>
      Kinetics is the study of rates of reactions. <br>
      Quantum mechanics helps us study the mechanisms of chemical
      reactions</p>
    <p>Classical thermodynamics is based upon the equilibrium state. It
      is based upon the macroscopic (<i>i.e.</i>, no underlying
      knowledge of the crystal structure is required) measure of the <i>intrinsic</i>
      properties of a mineral such as,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>temperature </li>
      <li>density </li>
      <li>pressure </li>
      <li>volume </li>
      <li>solubility </li>
      <li>heat capacity </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using empirically derived parameters that describe the chemical
      and physical state of matter, thermodynamics predicts the energy
      changes for any given transformation. In essence, it tells us the
      most stable state or set of phases that should be present, given
      certain temperature, pressure and chemical conditions. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Thermodynamics predicts which mineral assemblages should occur in
      a given environment assuming they are in chemical equilibrium.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The term <b>phase</b> can be use synonymously with mineral if
      the <b>mineral</b> is homogeneous (<i>i.e</i>., not a
      solid-solution). A phase can be considered a solid, liquid or gas
      with each having its own <b>stability region or field</b> in
      terms of pressure and temperature conditions.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Phase</b>: Physically distinct, Mechanically separable,
      homogeneous. Phases are described by independent chemical species
      known as components.<br>
    </p>
    <p><i>e.g.</i>, Quartz, SiO<sub>2</sub> or Kyanite, Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Components</b> are the smallest number of chemical entities to
      define the composition of all phases in the a system.<br>
    </p>
    <p>e.g., Si and O<sub>2</sub> are components of quartz or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
      and SiO<sub>2</sub> are components of Kyanite<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>System</b> - a quantity of material defined by weights or
      numbers of molecules. (imagine a container around the system, but
      the container is not part of the system.</p>
    <p><b>Example of phase equilibrium - H</b><sub><b>2</b></sub><b>O <img

          height="235" width="271"><br>
      </b></p>
    <p>Although thermodynamics tell us which reactions should take
      place, it does not tell us how fast a reaction will go.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Unary</b> <b>systems</b>. Examples given are H<sub>2</sub>O,
      SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> where each can
      be considered a single component system with multiple phases at
      different temperature and pressure conditions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Anatomy of a phase or stability diagram.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Divariant area</b> - region where both T and P can be varied
      independently without changing the number of the phases present.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Univariant curve</b> - loci of points (curve) where two phases
      coexist. Only T or P can be varied independently without changing
      the number of the phase present.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Triple point</b> - The location where all three phases can
      coexist. It is an invariant point where neither T, P or any other
      intrinsic parameter can not be changed without causing one phase
      to disappear.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The liquid-vapor curve extends to a point where the pressure is
      so great that the phase remains a liquid. So great that the fluid
      is often referred to as a supercritical fluid. The point in T,P
      space is termed the Critical Point.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Metastability.</b> At each invariant point there is region
      where the univariant curve extends beyond slightly into a third
      phase region. The reason for this condition is attributed to the
      additional energy that is required to nucleate a new phase. In the
      absence of nucleation energy, a metastable phase can persist into
      another stability region. A common example is super-cooled water
      (achieved by placing a bubble free container of distilled water in
      the freezer). When carefully removed from the freezer, a tap with
      a knife will cause instantaneous crystallization. This is referred
      to as the latent heat of crystallization and in the case of
      solid-gas transformation, the latent heat of vaporization.</p>
