      <hr>Crystallography: ordered forms</h3>
    <p><b>Crystal</b> - a regular geometric solid bounded by smooth
      surfaces.</p>
    <p><b>Crystalline</b> - homogeneous solid containing long-range
      three dimensional order. Order implies repetition in space (i.e.,
      found in intervals of equal distance).</p>
    <p><b>Motif - </b>the unit of pattern (e.g., the flower repeated on
      wall paper or wrapping paper design). In two dimensional space, it
      is easy to think of the translation of an object in a pattern in
      any X and Y direction.</p>
    <h3 align="center">
      <hr>2-dimensional symmetry (Plane Groups)</h3>
    <p><i>Examples</i>: <b>2-D square lattice</b>. To translate a motif
      (the snail) in space we employ rules of symmetry.</p>
    <p><b>Rules of symmetry</b> are the way we describe the orderly
      repetition of a motif in space. In the 2-D example of a square or
      isoclinic plane lattice, we use the rule or <b>geometric
        operation</b> of a <b>translation </b>to move the snail an
      equal distance in an XY coordinate system. The coordinate system
      is defined by increments whose unit lengths (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>)
      are equal and whose axes are at right angles to each other (The
      Cartesian coordinate system is a square lattice whose unit lengths
      are equal to one (<font face="Symbol">&#947;</font> = 90°).</p>
    <p>Points or nodes connecting each other collectively form a net
      that is called a <b>lattice</b>.</p>
    <p>Square or Isoclinic (<i>a = b, </i><font face="Symbol">&#947;</font>
      = 90°)</p>

    <p>The area (or volume in the case of 3-D) that comprises the unit
      length's distances between lattice points is known as the <b>unit
        cell</b>.</p>
    <p>The <b>primitive</b> (<i>p</i>) unit cell is that which contains
      nodes only at the corners of the unit cell and has the smallest
      possible repeat distance that can be translated along the x and y
      directions to produce the entire pattern.</p>
    <hr align="left"><b>Rectangular lattice:</b> Unit lengths along x
    and y are not of equal lengths.
    <p>Orthoclinic (<i>a</i> not equal to <i>b</i>, <i><font

    <hr align="left"><b>Oblique lattice:</b> The angles between the axes
    do not intersect at right angles or 60° and 120°. (<i>i.e.,</i> <i>a</i>
    not equal to <i>b</i>, <font face="Symbol">&#947;</font> not equal to
    60°, 90 or 120°).

    <hr align="left"><b>Hexagonal lattice:</b> Special case systems
    where the translation distances are equal and the angles are 60° and
    120° respectively. (<i>a </i>= <i>b</i>,<font face="Symbol"> </font><font
      face="Symbol">&#947; </font>= 60°). Also referred to as a rhombic.

    <p>The choice of a unit cell is a manner of convention. A primitive
      lattice may also be described as a rectangular lattice with a <b>centered</b>
      (<i>c</i>) unit cell. The reason for chosing the convention of a
      non-primative unit cell is to enable description of pattern using
      higher symmetry operations (more on this later).</p>

      <hr>Symmetry elements without translations.</h3>
    <p><b>Symmetry element</b> - locus of points or point that aid
      visualizing the symmetrical repeat of a motif.</p>
    <p><b>Symmetry operation</b> - is the act of moving the motif about
      the element.</p>
    <p>One type of a geometric operation that reproduces a motif is a <b>rotation</b>.
      The object is to create a pattern by moving the motif about an
      imaginary axis through some angle ( <font face="Symbol">a</font>).



      The axis is the element and rotation is the operation.</p>
    <p>The amount of rotational symmetry is designated by an integer (n)
      from 1 to infinity. n is defined by 360° divided by the number of
      rotational degrees in the operation. Remember, you must return to
      the original position of the motif.</p>
    <p>A good example can be seen by viewing a <a href="beercans.gif">beer




        can</a>. The bottom appears with an infinte amount of rotational
      symmetry while the top view appears to have an n equal to one.</p>
    <p>Because of geometrical constraints (all the polyhedron must be
      space occupied) the internal order of a crystal is limited to
      1-fold, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-fold axis (<i>i.e.</i>, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or
      6).</p>

    <hr align="left">Other symmetry operations include the creation of
    new pattern through a <b>mirror</b> plane image (<i>m</i>).
    <p>The example below combines two operations, including a mirror
      plane reflection and a translation that is known as a glide plane
      translation (<i>g</i>). The elements for a glide symmetry (a plane
      and an axis in this case) must occupy a common place in 3-D space.</p>
